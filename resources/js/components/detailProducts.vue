              whether you're on a video call with a friend, cutting a track, or
              recording a podcast, the microphones on iMac make sure you come
              through loud, crisp, and clear. The studio-quality three-mic array
              is designed to reduce feedback, so conversations flow more
              naturally and you interrupt each other less. And beamforming
              technology helps the mics ignore background noise. Which means
              everyone hears you - not what's going on around you.

              the sound system on iMac brings incredible, room-filling audio to
              any space. Two pairs of force-canceling woofers create rich, deep
              bass without unwanted vibrations. And each pair is balanced with a
              high-performance tweeter. The result is a massive, detailed
              soundstage that takes your movies, music, and more to the next
              level.

                M1 chip: with great power comes great capability:
              </span>
              M1 is the most powerful chip Apple has ever made. macOS Big Sur is
              an advanced desktop operating system. Combined, they take iMac to
              entirely new levels of performance, efficiency, and security. iMac
              wakes from sleep almost instantly, apps launch in a flash, and the
              whole system feels fluid, smooth, and snappy. With up to 85
              percent faster CPU performance and up to two times faster graphics
              performance than standard 21.5-inch iMac models, you can use apps
              like Xcode and Affinity Photo to compile code in a fraction of the
              time or edit photos in real time. And it runs cool and quiet even
              while tackling these intense workloads. That's the power of
              hardware, software, and silicon - all designed together.
